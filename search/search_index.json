Example Patch Specifications Euclidean Rhythms up to 32 beats long Rhythms are both reversible and invertible External clock input Sync input for syncing the start of the rhythm with another signal Shift knob for selecting the initial beat of the rhythm Lots of CV controllable parameters Panel Out : Output A pulse is output when an on-beat (hit) is clocked. 0-10V Unipolar CV 1ms pulse duration. Clk : Input On pulse advances the current beat. Schmitt triggered. Sync : Input On pulse resets the current beat to the first beat of the rhythm. Schmitt triggered. Len : Input The number of beats in the rhythm. Integer range between 1 to 32 inclusive. Hits : Input The number of on-beats in the rhythm, or the density. Integer range between 0 and the current Length inclusive. Shift : Input Sets the beat in the rhythm to start from. A sync pulse will reset the current beat to this beat. Integer range between 0 and the current Length - 1 inclusive. Reverse : Input Sets the direction that the clock advances the beat. Clockwise when Off, Anticlockwise when On. Invert : Input Inverts the Euclidean algorithm. When this switch is on on-beats become off-beats and off-beats become on-beats. Visually you can tell this is enabled by the on-beats being represented as empty circles rather than whole ones. CV : Input All manually controlled inputs are also CV controllable. Len, Hits and Shift have +-5V bipolar CV inputs with a knob for adjusting CV gain. The CV is summed with the current knob setting. Reverse and Invert have Schmitt triggered CV inputs that override the switch settings.","title":"Orbits Manual"},{"location":"#orbits-manual","text":"","title":"Orbits Manual"},{"location":"#eugene","text":"Eugene is a Euclidean Rhythm Generator plugin for VCV Rack .","title":"Eugene"},{"location":"#example-patch","text":"","title":"Example Patch"},{"location":"#specifications","text":"Euclidean Rhythms up to 32 beats long Rhythms are both reversible and invertible External clock input Sync input for syncing the start of the rhythm with another signal Shift knob for selecting the initial beat of the rhythm Lots of CV controllable parameters","title":"Specifications"},{"location":"#panel","text":"","title":"Panel"},{"location":"#out-output","text":"A pulse is output when an on-beat (hit) is clocked. 0-10V Unipolar CV 1ms pulse duration.","title":"Out : Output"},{"location":"#clk-input","text":"On pulse advances the current beat.
